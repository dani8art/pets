# PETS API

This project contains an example of RESTful API which is developed in Node JS, using [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) and [Baucis JS](https://github.com/wprl/baucis). The main objective is to have a microservice for testing others microservices, infrastructures, new plugins, new npm modules and new integrations.
